Function Progamming:

Functions:
- A function should take an input and must return an output.
- A true function must have a relationship between input and an output.
- Function calls should avoid side effects.
- There must be a semantic relationship b/w inputs and outputs.


Pure Functions:
- Impure or Pure Function is Not a binary - YES OR NO
- "Either function call behaves pure or doesn't behave pure"

Extracting Impurity:
- If you can't extract impurity, you can reduce it.
